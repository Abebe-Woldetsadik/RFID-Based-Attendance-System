# RFID-Based-Attendance-System
The RFID-Based Attendance System is a modern solution designed to simplify and automate attendance management using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology integrated with a Django web application.

In this system, each user (student/employee) is provided with a unique RFID card or tag. When the RFID card is scanned by the reader, the system automatically captures the attendance data and records it in the Django-based backend. The web application manages user details, attendance logs, and provides administrators with a user-friendly dashboard to monitor attendance in real-time.

Key Features:

RFID Integration: Automatic attendance recording using RFID cards/tags.
User Management: Add, update, and manage student or employee profiles.
Real-Time Attendance Tracking: Instantly records check-in and check-out times.
Secure Backend (Django): Ensures data integrity and reliability.
Reports & Analytics: View and generate daily, weekly, or monthly attendance reports.
Scalable Design: Can be integrated into schools, offices, or organizations.
This system eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking, reduces errors, and ensures accurate time management. With Django as the backend framework, the system is highly customizable, scalable, and secure for real-world applications.
